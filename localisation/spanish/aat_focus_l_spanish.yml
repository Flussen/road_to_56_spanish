On the other hand we have Jonas Lie, who from the beginning has been a forceful proponent of [GetNorwegianFascistOverlord]'s occupation of the [ROOT.GetName], and an implacable agent of order when needed. He should be the one leading his people in the pursuit of our ally's goals."
 NOR_bring_back_quisling: "Bring back Quisling"
 NOR_bring_back_quisling_desc: "Many see him as a clueless buffoon, but Quisling's rise to power hints to a cunning plan behind his supposed failures. This is the kind of man that needs to be at the helm, to guide [NOR.GetName] to new and bountiful lands like the vikings of old."

 NOR_a_valuable_partner_to_germany_desc: "The success of this nation is intrinsically tied to [GetNorwegianFascistOverlord]'s.

 NOR_invite_german_engineers: "Invite Fascist Engineers"
 NOR_invite_german_engineers_desc: "[NOR.GetName] has never been an industrial powerhouse, our predecessors focused more on trading than producing our own products.

 NOR_the_kings_abdication_desc: "The king and his Chamberlain, upon realizing the daunting power of our invaders, have nothing left to give to their people, or take from them.

 NOR_claims_on_ireland_desc: "What was once just a black lagoon our Norse ancestors settled and called Duibhlinn. From this seemingly insignificant place many Vikings thrived, raided and mingled with Gaelic tribes. Surely they won't mind if we take it back, by word or by force."

 NOR_demand_king_haakons_rise_to_power_desc: "Thanks to a rousing speech by Baron Wedel-Jarlsberg, the people of [NOR.GetName] clamor for a strong willed monarchy to take over the reigns of the government.

 NOR_the_crowns_executive_powers: "The Crown's Executive Powers"
 NOR_the_crowns_executive_powers_desc: "As the king continues to reject any calls for him to wield absolute power, we have no choice but to grant him executive powers. When he wakes up from his political slumber, he will have the tools to guide [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] towards glory!"

 NOR_swedish_claims_desc: "[NOR_GetSwedishClaimsDesc]"
 NOR_swedish_claims_desc_mon: "Unwillingly, our history and royalties have been tied to [SWE.GetNonIdeologyName]'s. During that back and forth that has lasted centuries, the [SWE.GetAdjective] stole vast tracts of land; Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.

 NOR_eirik_raudes_land_desc: "The Hague's absurd decision in 1933 must be overturned. How dare they let [DEN.GetName] have the land that Erik the Red, a Norwegian, discovered a millennium back.

 NOR_kickstart_military_industry: "Kickstart Military Industry"
 NOR_kickstart_military_industry_desc: "[ROOT.GetName] has been a subject of other nations for a long time, and thus never developed an internal military industry. To protect our freedom, we must stop relying on other countries for our defensive production and start building up our war machine."

 NOR_rikstanken: "Rikstanken"
 NOR_rikstanken_desc: "The sad truth is, [ROOT.GetName] has never owned a tank before. If we hope to have any chance of victory, armor is a given. The question is, what should our approach be?

Or maybe, we can sacrifice something other than money for the nation's tanks."
 NOR_tank_procurement: "Tank Procurement"
 NOR_tank_procurement_desc: "Our indigenous tank program is clearly insufficient for the armored warfare of the 20th century. The bright side is that many countries with the required expertise and production volume might be making their armored vehicles available for sale, this would be a great shortcut for bringing the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Army into this century."
 NOR_norges_rikstanksfabrikk: "Norges Rikstanksfabrikk"
 NOR_norges_rikstanksfabrikk_desc: "Now that we've learned the basics of armored warfare, we are ready to develop our own national tank manufacturing program, or Rikstanksfabrikk. It is the only way we can guarantee an uninterrupted supply of armored vehicles."

 NOR_improve_production_lines_desc: "There is no point in bravery in the defense of our country if we can't provide the weapons and equipment to keep fighting. Modern warfare is all about having the bullets to fight back, let's make sure we can make them as fast as we can fire them."

 NOR_hurtigruten_desc: "There's no denying that [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyName] is not only an unusually long country, but also has very difficult terrain all around.

 NOR_norges_tekniske_hogskole: "Norges Tekniske Høgskole"
 NOR_norges_tekniske_hogskole_desc: "For over two decades, the Norwegian institute of Technology in Trondheim has been at the forefront of engineering in the country, but if we hope to compete with our neighbors and possibly our enemies, more funding into technical education will be necessary.

 NOR_empower_large_industrial_groups_desc: "Large industrial enterprises have a proven track record of building and maintaining factories, producing the every day necessities of the average [ROOT.GetAdjective] citizen.

 NOR_build_the_northern_rail: "Build the Northern Rail"
 NOR_build_the_northern_rail_desc: "Too long has the northern part of our country been neglected. Though the terrain makes building infrastructure a complicated endeavor, it's an effort that we are sure will pay dividends in the future."

 NOR_increase_research_funding: "Increase Research Funding"

 NOR_haerens_flyvevaaben_desc: "The new frontier of warfare is in the skies. If we let the enemy have total control over our airspace, our ground forces will not be able to act effectively. We must develop an air force that can act in favor of our ground troops."
 NOR_norwegian_planes: "Norwegian Planes "

 NOR_expand_merchant_marine_desc: "Modern warfare needs resources and equipment, two things that [ROOT.GetName] is desperately lacking.

 DEN_expand_haerens_tekniske_korps_desc: "The Army’s Technical Corps operates the Weapons Arsenal and Hærens Geværfabrik, which produces both weapons and ammunition.

 DEN_convert_automobile_production: "Convert Automobile Production"
 DEN_convert_automobile_production_desc: "The time has come to order Danish automobile manufacturers to convert their civilian production lines to contribute to the war effort and support our defense capabilities.
